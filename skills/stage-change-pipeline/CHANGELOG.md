## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-25
- Initial canonical package for the stage-change pipeline.
- Converts design-stage context into OpenSpec changes, parallel Codex review, fixes, and fine-grained GitHub issues.
- Includes small-PR issue splitting rules based on module, ownership, dependency, and verification boundaries.
- Documents how Stage 3 aligns with `risk-adaptive-cross-review` OpenSpec review semantics.
- Documents reuse points for `clarify`, `future-aware-architecture`, `implementation-planning`, `project-documentation`, and `gh-create-issue`.
- Adds an Implementation-Ready Issue Contract so downstream implementation workflows should not need requirements clarification.
- Requires `Implementation Ready: yes` on generated sub-issues before they can enter `codex-codeagent-workflow`.
